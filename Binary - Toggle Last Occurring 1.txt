Binary - Toggle Last Occurring 1 The program must accept an integer N as the input. The program must toggle the last occurring 1 in the binary representation of N. Then the program must print the modified value of N as the output. Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= N < 2^31 Input Format: The first line contains N. Output Format: The first line contains the modified value of N. Example Input/Output 1: Input: 10 Output: 8 Explanation: The binary representation of 10 is 1010. The last occurring 1 in 1010 is toggled to 0. So the binary representation becomes 1000. Now the decimal equivalent of 1000 is 8. Hence the output is 8 Example Input/Output 2: Input: 16 Output: 0
