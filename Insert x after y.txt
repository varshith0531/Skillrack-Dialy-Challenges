function - insertXAfterY The function/method insertXAfterY accepts two arguments X and Y representing two integer values. The function/method insertXAfterY must insert a node with the value X after the first occurring node with the value Y in the singly linked list. If there is no node with the value Y, then the function must append a node with the value X to the singly linked list. Your task is to implement the function insertXAfterY so that it passes all the test cases. IMPORTANT: Do not write the main() function as it is already defined. Example Input/Output 1: Input: 6 10 20 30 40 30 50 55 30 Output: 10 20 30 55 40 30 50 Explanation: Here X = 55 and Y = 30. So 55 is inserted after the first occurrence of 30. Now the singly linked list becomes 10 20 30 55 40 30 50 Example Input/Output 2: Input: 5 10 20 30 40 50 25 80 Output: 10 20 30 40 50 25
