Sum - Remove Tenth Digit The program must accept N integers as the input. The program must remove the tenth digit of all the N integers. Then the program must print the sum of N modified integers as the output. Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= N <= 100 10 <= Each integer value <= 10^5 Input Format: The first line contains N. The second line contains N integers separated by a space. Output Format: The first line contains the sum of N modified integers. Example Input/Output 1: Input: 4 180 212 5295 5001 Output: 1058 Explanation: After removing the tenth digit of all the four integers, the integer values become 10 22 525 501. So the sum is 1058 (10+22+525+501). Hence the output is 1058 Example Input/Output 2: Input: 7 4483 61 141 79 814 4937 3174 Output: 1359
