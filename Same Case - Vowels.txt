Same Case - Vowels The program must accept a string S containing only alphabets as the input. The program must print YES if all the vowels in the string S are same case (i.e either upper case or lower case). Else the program must print NO as the output. Note: At least one vowel is always present in the string S. Boundary Condition(s): 1 <= Length of S <= 1000 Input Format: The first line contains S. Output Format: The first line contains YES or NO. Example Input/Output 1: Input: SkillRack Output: YES Explanation: The string SkillRack contains two vowels i and a. Here i and a are in lower case. So YES is printed as the output. Example Input/Output 2: Input: Information Output: NO Example Input/Output 3: Input: EIgHtEEn Output: YES
