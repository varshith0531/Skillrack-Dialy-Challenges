The program must accept a string S as the input. The program must find and print the number of occurrences of the last two characters of S in the same string S as the output.
Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= Length of S <= 10^4 
Input Format: The first line contains S. 
Output Format: The first line contains the number of occurrences of the last two characters of S in the same string S. 
Example Input/Output 1: 
Input: hiabchi 
Output: 2 
Explanation: The last two characters of the string hiabchi are h and i. Here the hi has occurred 2 times in the string hiabchi. Hence the output is 2
Example Input/Output 2: 
Input: MOOONOO 
Output: 3
Python code:
def count_last_two_characters(s):
    last_two_characters = s[-2:]
    count = s.count(last_two_characters)
    return count
s = input().strip()
print(count_last_two_characters(s))
