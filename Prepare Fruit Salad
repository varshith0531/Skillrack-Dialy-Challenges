There are X kgs of Apple, Y kgs of Banana and Z kgs of Watermelon in a fruit shop. To prepare a box of fruit salad (7kgs), the fruits are required in the ratio of 1 : 2 : 4 (Apple : Banana : Watermelon). The program must print the maximum number of boxes of fruit salad that can be prepared from the given quantity of fruits as the output.
Boundary Condition(s): 0 <= X, Y, Z <= 1000 
Input Format: The first line contains X, Y and Z separated by a space. 
Output Format: The first line contains the maximum number of boxes of fruit salad that can be prepared from the given quantity of fruits. 
Example Input/Output 1:
Input: 2 5 7 
Output: 1 
Explanation: There are 2kgs of Apple, 5kgs of Banana and 7kgs of Watermelon. The ratio of fruits required to prepare a box of fruit salad is 1 : 2 : 4 (Apple : Banana : Watermelon). Here, only 1 box of fruit salad is possible to prepare from the 2kgs of Apple, 5kgs of Banana and 7kgs of Watermelon. So 1 is printed as the output. 
Example Input/Output 2: Input: 4 8 14 Output: 3 Example Input/Output 3: Input: 2 10 3 Output: 0

Python code:
def max_fruit_boxes(x, y, z):
    max_boxes_apple = x // 1
    max_boxes_banana = y // 2
    max_boxes_watermelon = z // 4
    max_boxes = min(max_boxes_apple, max_boxes_banana, max_boxes_watermelon)
    return max_boxes
x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
print(max_fruit_boxes(x, y, z))
